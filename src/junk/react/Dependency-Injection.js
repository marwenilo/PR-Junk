// Many of the modules/components that we write have dependencies. 
// Proper management of these dependencies is critical for the success of the project. There is a technique (most people consider it a pattern) 
// called dependency injection that helps to solve the problem.

// In React the need for dependency injector is easily visible. Let‚Äôs consider the following application tree:

// Title.js
export default function Title(props) {
    return <h1>{ props.title }</h1>;
  }
  
  // Header.js
  import Title from './Title.js';
  
  export default function Header() {
    return (
      <header>
        <Title />
      </header>
    );
  }
  
  // App.js
  import Header from './Header.js';
  
  class App extends React.Component {
    state = { title: 'React in patterns' };
    
    render() {
      return <Header />;
    }
  };



//   The string ‚ÄúReact in patterns‚Äù should somehow reach the Title component. 
//   The direct way of doing this is to pass it from App to Header and then Header pass it down to Title. 
//   However, this may work for these three components but what happens if there are multiple properties and deeper nesting. 
//   Lots of components will act as a proxy, passing properties to their children.

// The higher-order component may be used to inject data. 
// Let‚Äôs use the same technique to inject the title variable:

// inject.js
const title = 'React in patterns';

export default function inject(Component) {
  return class Injector extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <Component
          {...this.props}
          title={ title }
        />
      )
    }
  };
}

// -----------------------------------
// Header.js
import inject from './inject.js';
import Title from './Title.js';

let EnhancedTitle = inject(Title);
export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <EnhancedTitle />
    </header>
  );
}
// The title is hidden in a middle layer (higher-order component) where we pass it as a prop to the original Title component. 
// That‚Äôs all nice but it solves only half of the problem. 
// Now we don‚Äôt have to pass the title down the tree but how this data reaches the inject.jsx helper.

// ====>Using React‚Äôs context (v. 16.3 and above)

// For years the context API was not really recommended by Facebook. They mentioned in the official docs that the API is not stable and may change. 
// And that is exactly what happened. 
// In version 16.3, we got a new one which is more natural and easy to work with.


// We will start by defining a file that will contain our context initialization:

//context.js
import { createContext } from 'react';

const Context = createContext({});

export const Provider = Context.Provider;
export const Consumer = Context.Consumer;

// createContext returns an object that has .Provider and .Consumer properties. 
// Those are actually valid React classes. The Provider accepts our context in the form of a value prop. 
// The consumer is used to access the context and basically read data from it. 
// And because they usually live in different files it is a good idea to create a single place for their initialization.

// Let‚Äôs say that our App component is the root of our tree. That is where we have to pass the context.

import { Provider } from './context';
/***************************************************/
const context = { title: 'React In Patterns' };
/***************************************************/
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider value={ context }>
        <Header />
      </Provider>
    );
  }
};
// The wrapped components and their children now share the same context. 
// The <Title> component is the one that needs the title string so that is the place where we use the <Consumer>.

import { Consumer } from './context';

function Title() {
  return (
    <Consumer>{
      ({ title }) => <h1>Title: { title }</h1>
    }</Consumer>
  );
}
// Notice that the Consumer class uses the function as children (render prop) pattern to deliver the context.

// Using the module system 

// If we don‚Äôt want to use the context there are a couple of other ways to achieve the injection. 
// They are not exactly React specific, but worth mentioning nevertheless. One of them is to use the module system.

// the typical module system in JavaScript has a caching mechanism. It‚Äôs nicely noted in Node‚Äôs documentation:

/*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*/
// ***Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. 
// This means (among other things) that every call to require(‚Äòfoo‚Äô) will get exactly the same object returned, if it would resolve to the same file.***

/*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*/
// ***Multiple calls to require(‚Äòfoo‚Äô) may not cause the module code to be executed multiple times. 
// This is an important feature. With it, ‚Äúpartially done‚Äù objects can be returned, 
// thus allowing transitive dependencies to be loaded even when they would cause cycles.***


// How does that help in our injection? 
// Well, if we export an object we are actually exporting a singleton and every other module that imports the file will get the same object. 
// This allows us to register our dependencies and later fetch them in another file.

// by create a new file called "di.js" with the following content:

var dependencies = {};

export function register(key, dependency) {
  dependencies[key] = dependency;
}

export function fetch(key) {
  if (dependencies[key]) return dependencies[key];
  throw new Error(`"${ key } is not registered as dependency.`);
}

export function wire(Component, deps, mapper) {
  return class Injector extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this._resolvedDependencies = mapper(...deps.map(fetch));
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <Component
          {...this.state}
          {...this.props}
          {...this._resolvedDependencies}
        />
      );
    }
  };
}

// We‚Äôll store the dependencies in dependencies global variable (it‚Äôs global for our module, not for the whole application). 
// We then export two functions register and fetch that write and read entries. 
// It looks a little bit like implementing setter and getter functions against a simple JavaScript object. 
// Then we have the wire function that accepts our React component and returns a higher-order component. 
// In the constructor of that component we are resolving the dependencies and later, 
// while rendering the original component, we pass them as props. 
// We follow the same pattern where we describe what we need (deps argument) and extract the needed props with a mapper function.

// Having the di.jsx helper, we are once again able to register our dependencies at the entry point of our application (app.jsx) and inject them wherever (Title.jsx) we need.

// app.js
import Header from './Header.js';
import { register } from './di.js';

register('my-awesome-title', 'React in patterns');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Header />;
  }
};

// -----------------------------------
// Header.js
import Title from './Title.js';

export default function Header() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Title />
    </header>
  );
}

// -----------------------------------
// Title.js
import { wire } from './di.js';

var Title = function(props) {
  return <h1>{ props.title }</h1>;
};

export default wire(
  Title,
  ['my-awesome-title'],
  title => ({ title })
);

// If we look at the Title.jsx file we‚Äôll see that the actual component and the wiring may live in different files. 
// That way the component and the mapper function become easily unit testable.
